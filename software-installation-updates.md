### Software Installation Updates

#### pgAdmin

I keep a close watch on pgAdmin development. If you experience any issues with pgAdmin function or installation, either file a ticket in this repo or email me at `practicalsqlbook@gmail.com` for assistance.


#### Windows

- **Windows 11**: Installation of PostgreSQL, as described beginning on page 4 of Chapter 1, is the same under Windows 11 as under Windows 10. However, Windows 11 has a different-style Start Menu. As a result, after installation, you will find the PostgreSQL and PostGIS folders under Start Menu > All Apps.
- **Stack Builder**: Downloading the installer for PostGIS may take a few minutes. During this time, it may seem the program is stuck, but it's not. Patience is key, I remind myself.
- **PostGIS installer updates**: > The PostGIS installer for Windows now asks you to check off which components to install rather than providing individual Yes/No prompts. You can select all components including Create Spatial Database. (Applies to printings one through three of the book.)
- **Python Support via Language Pack**: > The EDB installer for Windows no longer includes the Language Pack. See [this issue](https://github.com/anthonydb/practical-sql-2/issues/32) for details on how to configure Python support.
