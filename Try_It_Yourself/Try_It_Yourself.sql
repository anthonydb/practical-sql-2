-- Try It Yourself Questions and Answers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 2: Creating Your First Database and Table
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Imagine you're building a database to catalog all the animals at your
-- local zoo. You want one table to track the kinds of animals in the
-- collection and another table to track the specifics on each animal. Write
-- CREATE TABLE statements for each table that include some of the columns
-- you need. Why did you include the columns you chose?

-- Answer (yours will vary):

-- The first table will hold the animal types and their conservation status:

CREATE TABLE animal_types (
    animal_type_id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    common_name text NOT NULL,
    scientific_name text NOT NULL,
    conservation_status text NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT common_name_unique UNIQUE (common_name)
);

-- It's OK if your answer doesn't have all the keywords in the example above. Those
-- keywords reference concepts you'll learn in later chapters, including table
-- constraints, primary keys and and IDENTITY columns. What's important is that you
-- considered the individual data items you would want to track.

-- The second table will hold data on individual animals. Note that the
-- column animal_type_id references the column of the same name in the
-- table animal types. This is a foreign key, which you will learn about in
-- Chapter 8.

CREATE TABLE menagerie (
   menagerie_id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   common_name text REFERENCES animal_types (common_name),
   date_acquired date NOT NULL,
   gender text,
   acquired_from text,
   name text,
   notes text
);

-- 2. Now create INSERT statements to load sample data into the tables.
-- How can you view the data via the pgAdmin tool?

-- Answer (again, yours will vary):

INSERT INTO animal_types (common_name, scientific_name, conservation_status)
VALUES ('Bengal Tiger', 'Panthera tigris tigris', 'Endangered'),
       ('Arctic Wolf', 'Canis lupus arctos', 'Least Concern');
-- data source: https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?direction=desc&sort=extinction_status

INSERT INTO menagerie (common_name, date_acquired, gender, acquired_from, name, notes)
VALUES
('Bengal Tiger', '3/12/1996', 'F', 'Dhaka Zoo', 'Ariel', 'Healthy coat at last exam.'),
('Arctic Wolf', '9/30/2000', 'F', 'National Zoo', 'Freddy', 'Strong appetite.');

-- To view data via pgAdmin, in the object browser, right-click Tables and
-- select Refresh. Then right-click the table name and select
-- View/Edit Data > All Rows


-- 2b. Create an additional INSERT statement for one of your tables. On purpose,
-- leave out one of the required commas separating the entries in the VALUES
-- clause of the query. What is the error message? Does it help you find the
-- error in the code?

-- Answer: In this case, the error message points to the missing comma.

INSERT INTO animal_types (common_name, scientific_name, conservation_status)
VALUES ('Javan Rhino', 'Rhinoceros sondaicus' 'Critically Endangered');


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 3: Beginning Data Exploration with SELECT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. The school district superintendent asks for a list of teachers in each
-- school. Write a query that lists the schools in alphabetical order along
-- with teachers ordered by last name A-Z.

-- Answer:

SELECT school, first_name, last_name
FROM teachers
ORDER BY school, last_name;

-- 2. Write a query that finds the one teacher whose first name starts
-- with the letter 'S' and who earns more than $40,000.

-- Answer:

SELECT first_name, last_name, school, salary
FROM teachers
WHERE first_name LIKE 'S%' -- remember that LIKE is case-sensitive!
      AND salary > 40000;

-- 3. Rank teachers hired since Jan. 1, 2010, ordered by highest paid to lowest.

-- Answer:

SELECT last_name, first_name, school, hire_date, salary
FROM teachers
WHERE hire_date >= '2010-01-01'
ORDER BY salary DESC;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 4: Understanding Data Types
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Your company delivers fruit and vegetables to local grocery stores, and
-- you need to track the mileage driven by each driver each day to a tenth
-- of a mile. Assuming no driver would ever travel more than 999 miles in
-- a day, what would be an appropriate data type for the mileage column in your
-- table. Why?

-- Answer:

numeric(4,1)

-- numeric(4,1) provides four digits total (the precision) and one digit after
-- the decimal (the scale). That would allow you to store a value as large
-- as 999.9.

-- In practice, you may want to consider that the assumption on maximum miles
-- in a day could conceivably exceed 999.9 and go with the larger numeric(5,1).

-- 2. In the table listing each driver in your company, what are appropriate
-- data types for the drivers’ first and last names? Why is it a good idea to
-- separate first and last names into two columns rather than having one
-- larger name column?

-- Answer:

varchar(50)
-- or
text

-- 50 characters is a reasonable length for names, and using either varchar(50)
-- or text ensures you will not waste space when names are shorter. Using text will
-- ensure that if you run into the exceptionally rare circumstance of a name longer
-- than 50 characters, you'll be covered. Also, separating first and last names
-- into their own columns will let you later sort on each independently.


-- 3. Assume you have a text column that includes strings formatted as dates.
-- One of the strings is written as '4//2017'. What will happen when you try
-- to convert that string to the timestamp data type?

-- Answer: Attempting to convert a string of text that does not conform to
-- accepted date/time formats will result in an error. You can see this with
-- the below example, which tries to cast the string as a timestamp.

SELECT CAST('4//2021' AS timestamp with time zone);


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 5: Importing and Exporting Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Write a WITH statement to include with COPY to handle the import of an
-- imaginary text file whose first couple of rows look like this:

id:movie:actor
50:#Mission: Impossible#:Tom Cruise

-- Answer: The WITH statement will need the options seen here:

COPY actors
FROM 'C:\YourDirectory\movies.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER ':', QUOTE '#');

-- If you'd like to try actually importing this data, save the data in a file
-- called movies.txt and create the actors table below. You can then run the COPY
-- statement.

CREATE TABLE actors (
    id integer,
    movie text,
    actor text
);

-- Note: You may never encounter a file that uses a colon as a delimiter and
-- pound sign for quoting, but anything is possible!


-- 2. Using the table us_counties_pop_est_2019 you created and filled in this
-- chapter, export to a CSV file the 20 counties in the United States that had
-- the most births. Make sure you export only each county’s name, state, and
-- number of births. (Hint: births are totaled for each county in the column
-- births_2019.)

-- Answer:

COPY (
    SELECT county_name, state_name, births_2019
    FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 ORDER BY births_2019 DESC LIMIT 20
     )
TO 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_births_export.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);

-- Note: This COPY statement uses a SELECT statement to limit the output to
-- only the desired columns and rows.


-- 3. Imagine you're importing a file that contains a column with these values:
      -- 17519.668
      -- 20084.461
      -- 18976.335
-- Will a column in your target table with data type numeric(3,8) work for these
-- values? Why or why not?

-- Answer:
-- No, it won't. In fact, you won't even be able to create a column with that
-- data type because the precision must be larger than the scale. The correct
-- type for the example data is numeric(8,3).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 6: Basic Math and Stats with SQL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Write a SQL statement for calculating the area of a circle whose radius is
-- 5 inches. Do you need parentheses in your calculation? Why or why not?

-- Answer:
-- (The formula for the area of a circle is: pi * radius squared.)

SELECT 3.14 * 5 ^ 2;

-- The result is an area of 78.5 square inches.
-- Note: You do not need parentheses because exponents and roots take precedence
-- over multiplication. However, you could include parentheses for clarity. This
-- statement produces the same result:

SELECT 3.14 * (5 ^ 2);


-- 2. Using the 2019 Census county estimates data, calculate a ratio of births to 
-- deaths for each county in New York state. Which region of the state generally
-- saw a higher ratio of births to deaths in 2019?

-- Answer:

SELECT county_name,
       state_name,
       births_2019 AS births,
       deaths_2019 AS deaths,
       births_2019::numeric / deaths_2019 AS birth_death_ratio
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
WHERE state_name = 'New York'
ORDER BY birth_death_ratio DESC;

-- Generally, counties in and around New York City had the highest ratio of births
-- to deaths in the 2019 estimates. One exception to the trend is Jefferson County,
-- which is upstate on the U.S./Canadian border.

-- Note: There were six counties in the U.S. with zero deaths in 2019, according
-- to this data set -- in Hawaii, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Texas. If you modify
-- the query to filter on one of those states, you'll need to adjust the WHERE
-- clause to eliminate those zero-death counties because division by zero isn't 
-- allowed. To do that, modify your WHERE clause like this:

WHERE state_name = 'Texas' AND deaths_2019 > 0


-- 3. Was the 2019 median county population estimate higher in California or New York?

-- Answer:
-- California had a median county population estimate of 187,029 in 2019, almost double
-- that of New York, at 86,687. Here are two solutions:

-- First, you can find the median for each state one at a time:

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
        WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY pop_est_2019)
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
WHERE state_name = 'New York';

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
        WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY pop_est_2019)
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
WHERE state_name = 'California';

-- Or both in one query (credit: https://github.com/Kennith-eng)

SELECT state_name,
       percentile_cont(0.5)
          WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY pop_est_2019) AS median
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
WHERE state_name IN ('New York', 'California')
GROUP BY state_name;

-- Finally, this query shows the median for each state:

SELECT state_name,
       percentile_cont(0.5)
          WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY pop_est_2019) AS median
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
GROUP BY state_name;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 7: Joining Tables in a Relational Database
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. According to the census population estimates, which county had the
-- greatest percentage loss of population between 2010 and 2019? Try
-- an internet search to find out what happened. (Hint: The decrease is related
-- to a particular type of facility.)

-- Answer: 

-- Concho County, Texas, lost 33 percent of its population from 2010 to
-- 2019, the result of the closure of Eden Detention Center. 
-- https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/after-edens-prison-closes-what-comes-next-for-this-small-texas-town/

-- Simply use ASC in the ORDER BY clause to re-order the results, like this:
SELECT c2019.county_name,
       c2019.state_name,
       c2019.pop_est_2019 AS pop_2019,
       c2010.estimates_base_2010 AS pop_2010,
       c2019.pop_est_2019 - c2010.estimates_base_2010 AS raw_change,
       round( (c2019.pop_est_2019::numeric - c2010.estimates_base_2010)
           / c2010.estimates_base_2010 * 100, 1 ) AS pct_change       
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 AS c2019
    JOIN us_counties_pop_est_2010 AS c2010
ON c2019.state_fips = c2010.state_fips
    AND c2019.county_fips = c2010.county_fips
ORDER BY pct_change ASC;


-- 2. Apply the concepts you learned about UNION to create query 
-- results that merge queries of the census county population estimates
-- for 2010 and 2019. Your results should include a column called year
-- that specifies the year of the estimate for each row in the results.

-- Answer:
-- Note that you pass a string for the year in both queries.
SELECT '2010' AS year,
       state_fips,
       county_fips,
       county_name,
       state_name,
       estimates_base_2010 AS estimate
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2010
UNION 
SELECT '2019' AS year,
       state_fips,
       county_fips,
       county_name,
       state_name,       
       pop_est_2019 AS estimate
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
ORDER BY state_fips, county_fips, year;


-- 3. Using the percentile_cont() function from Chapter 6,
-- determine the median of the percent change in estimated county
-- population between 2010 and 2019.

-- Answer: -0.5%

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
       WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY round( (c2019.pop_est_2019::numeric - c2010.estimates_base_2010)
           / c2010.estimates_base_2010 * 100, 1 )) AS percentile_50th
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 AS c2019
    JOIN us_counties_pop_est_2010 AS c2010
ON c2019.state_fips = c2010.state_fips
    AND c2019.county_fips = c2010.county_fips;
    

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 8: Table Design That Works for You
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Consider the following two tables from a database you’re making to keep
-- track of your vinyl LP collection. Start by reviewing these CREATE TABLE
-- statements.

CREATE TABLE albums (
    album_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    catalog_code text,
    title text,
    artist text,
    release_date date,
    genre text,
    description text
);

CREATE TABLE songs (
    song_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    title text,
    composers text,
    album_id bigint
);

-- The albums table includes information specific to the overall collection
-- of songs on the disc. The songs table catalogs each track on the album.
-- Each song has a title and a column for its composers, who might be 
-- different than the album artist.

-- Use the tables to answer these questions:

-- 1. Modify these CREATE TABLE statements to include primary and foreign keys
-- plus additional constraints on both tables. Explain why you made your
-- choices.

-- Answer (yours may vary slightly):

CREATE TABLE albums (
    album_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    catalog_code text NOT NULL,
    title text NOT NULL,
    artist text NOT NULL,
    release_date date,
    genre text,
    description text,
    CONSTRAINT album_id_key PRIMARY KEY (album_id),
    CONSTRAINT release_date_check CHECK (release_date > '1/1/1925')
);

CREATE TABLE songs (
    song_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    composer text NOT NULL,
    album_id bigint REFERENCES albums (album_id),
    CONSTRAINT song_id_key PRIMARY KEY (song_id)
);

-- Answers:
-- a) Both tables get a primary key using surrogate key id values that are
-- auto-generated via IDENTITY.

-- b) The songs table references albums via a foreign key constraint.

-- c) In both tables, the title and artist/composer columns cannot be empty, which
-- is specified via a NOT NULL constraint. We assume that every album and
-- song should at minimum have that information.

-- d) In albums, the release_date column has a CHECK constraint
-- because it would be likely impossible for us to own an LP made before 1925.


-- 2. Instead of using album_id as a surrogate key for your primary key, are
-- there any columns in albums that could be useful as a natural key? What would
-- you have to know to decide?

-- Answer:
-- We could consider the catalog_code. We would have to answer yes to
-- these questions:
-- 1. Is it going to be unique across all albums released by all companies?
-- 2. Will an album always have a catalog code?


-- 3. To speed up queries, which columns are good candidates for indexes?

-- Answer:
-- Primary key columns get indexes by default, but we should add an index
-- to the album_id foreign key column in the songs table because we'll use
-- it in table joins. It's likely that we'll query these tables to search
-- by titles and artists, so those columns in both tables should get indexes
-- too. The release_date in albums also is a candidate if we expect
-- to perform many queries that include date ranges.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 9: Extracting Information by Grouping and Summarizing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. We saw that library visits have declined recently in most places. But 
-- what is the pattern in library employment? All three library survey tables
-- contain the column totstaff, which is the number of paid full-time equivalent
-- employees. Modify the code in Listings 9-13 and 9-14 to calculate the 
-- percent change in the sum of the column over time, examining all states as 
-- well as states with the most visitors. Watch out for negative values!

-- Answer (all states):

SELECT pls18.stabr,
       sum(pls18.totstaff) AS totstaff_2018,
       sum(pls17.totstaff) AS totstaff_2017,
       sum(pls16.totstaff) AS totstaff_2016,
       round( (sum(pls18.totstaff::numeric) - sum(pls17.totstaff)) /
            sum(pls17.totstaff) * 100, 1 ) AS chg_2018_17,
       round( (sum(pls17.totstaff::numeric) - sum(pls16.totstaff)) /
            sum(pls16.totstaff) * 100, 1 ) AS chg_2017_16
FROM pls_fy2018_libraries pls18
       JOIN pls_fy2017_libraries pls17 ON pls18.fscskey = pls17.fscskey

WHERE pls18.totstaff >= 0
       AND pls17.totstaff >= 0
       AND pls16.totstaff >= 0
GROUP BY pls18.stabr
ORDER BY chg_2018_17 DESC;

-- Answer (filtered with HAVING):

SELECT pls18.stabr,
       sum(pls18.totstaff) AS totstaff_2018,
       sum(pls17.totstaff) AS totstaff_2017,
       sum(pls16.totstaff) AS totstaff_2016,
       round( (sum(pls18.totstaff::numeric) - sum(pls17.totstaff)) /
            sum(pls17.totstaff) * 100, 1 ) AS chg_2018_17,
       round( (sum(pls17.totstaff::numeric) - sum(pls16.totstaff)) /
            sum(pls16.totstaff) * 100, 1 ) AS chg_2017_16

       AND pls16.totstaff >= 0
GROUP BY pls18.stabr
HAVING sum(pls18.visits) > 50000000
ORDER BY chg_2018_17 DESC;

-- 2. The library survey tables contain a column called obereg, a two-digit
-- Bureau of Economic Analysis Code that classifies each library agency
-- according to a region of the United States, such as New England, Rocky
-- Mountains, and so on. Just as we calculated the percent change in visits
-- grouped by state, do the same to group percent changes in visits by U.S.
-- region using obereg. Consult the survey documentation to find the meaning
-- of each region code. For a bonus challenge, create a table with the obereg
-- code as the primary key and the region name as text, and join it to the
-- summary query to group by the region name rather than the code.

-- Answer:

-- a) sum() visits by region.
    
SELECT pls18.obereg,
       sum(pls18.visits) AS visits_2018,
       sum(pls17.visits) AS visits_2017,

       AND pls16.visits >= 0
GROUP BY pls18.obereg
ORDER BY chg_2018_17 DESC;

-- b) Bonus: creating the regions lookup table and adding it to the query.

CREATE TABLE obereg_codes (

ORDER BY chg_2018_17 DESC;

-- 3. Thinking back to the types of joins you learned in Chapter 7,
-- which join type will show you all the rows in all three tables,
-- including those without a match? Write such a query and add an
-- IS NULL filter in a WHERE clause to show agencies not included
-- in one or more of the tables.

-- Answer: a FULL OUTER JOIN will show all rows in both tables.

SELECT pls18.libname, pls18.city, pls18.stabr, pls18.statstru, 
       pls17.libname, pls17.city, pls17.stabr, pls17.statstru,

       FULL OUTER JOIN pls_fy2016_libraries pls16 ON pls18.fscskey = pls16.fscskey
WHERE pls16.fscskey IS NULL OR pls17.fscskey IS NULL;

-- Note: The IS NULL statements in the WHERE clause limit results to those

-- Chapter 10: Inspecting and Modifying Data
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- In this exercise, you’ll turn the meat_poultry_egg_establishments table
-- into useful information. You need to answer two questions: How many 
-- of the companies in the table process meat, and how many process poultry?

-- Your tasks are as follows:

-- 1. Create two new columns called meat_processing and poultry_processing. Each
-- can be of the type boolean.

-- 2. Using UPDATE, set meat_processing = TRUE on any row where the activities
-- column contains the text 'Meat Processing'. Do the same update on the
-- poultry_processing column, but this time look for the text
-- 'Poultry Processing' in activities.

-- Use the data from the new, updated columns to count how many companies
-- perform each type of activity. For a bonus challenge, count how many
-- companies perform both activities.

-- Answer:
-- a) Add the columns

-- 1. In Listing 11-2, the correlation coefficient, or r value, of the
-- variables pct_bachelors_higher and median_hh_income was about .70.
-- Write a query using the same dataset to show the correlation between
-- pct_masters_higher and median_hh_income. Is the r value higher or lower?
-- What might explain the difference?

-- Answer:
-- The r value of pct_masters_higher and median_hh_income is about .60, which
-- shows a lower connection between percent master's degree or higher and
-- income than percent bachelor's degree or higher and income. One possible
-- explanation is that attaining a master's degree or higher may have a more
-- incremental impact on earnings than attaining a bachelor's degree.

-- ride to the shortest. Do you notice anything about the longest or shortest
-- trips that you might want to ask city officials about?

-- Answer: More than 480 of the trips last more than 10 hours, which seems
-- excessive. Moreover, two records have drop-off times before the pickup time,
-- and several have pickup and drop-off times that are the same. It's worth
-- asking whether these records have timestamp errors.

-- In which of those groups does Waikiki’s daily maximum temperature fall most
-- often?

-- Answer: Between 86 and 87 degrees. Nice.

-- 2. Revise the ice cream survey crosstab in Listing 13-17 to flip the table.
-- In other words, make flavor the rows and office the columns. Which elements

-- Answer: You need to re-order the columns in the first subquery so flavor is
-- first and office is second. count(*) stays third. Then, you must change
-- the second subquery to produce a grouped list of office. Finally, you must
-- add the office names to the output list.

-- 1. The style guide of a publishing company you're writing for wants you to
-- avoid commas before suffixes in names. But there are several names like
-- Alvarez, Jr. and Williams, Sr. in your author database. Which functions can
-- you use to remove the comma? Would a regular expression function help?
-- How would you capture just the suffixes to place them into a separate column?

-- Answer: You can use either the standard SQL replace() function or the
-- PostgreSQL regexp_replace() function:

SELECT replace('Williams, Sr.', ', ', ' ');
SELECT regexp_replace('Williams, Sr.', ', ', ' ');

-- Answer: To capture just the suffixes, search for characters after a comma
-- and space and place those inside a match group:

SELECT (regexp_match('Williams, Sr.', '.*, (.*)'))[1];


-- 2. Using any one of the presidents' speeches, count the number of
-- unique words that are five characters or more. Hint: you can use
-- regexp_split_to_table() in a subquery to create a table of words to count.
-- Bonus: remove commas and periods at the end of each word.

-- This query uses a Common Table Expression to first separate each word
-- in the text into a separate row in a table named word_list. As part of the
-- operation, we use nested replace functions to remove commas, periods, and
-- colons. Then the SELECT statement counts the words, which we convert
-- to lowercase so that when we count we group words that may appear with
-- various cases (e.g., "Military" and "military").

-- Thanks to reader @DavidSwagger for pointing out the replace function
-- needed to happen in the WITH statement.

-- aggregate the county data to find the area of each state in square
-- miles. (Use the statefp column in the us_counties_2019_shp table.)
-- How many states are bigger than the Yukon-Koyukuk area?

-- Answer: Just three states are bigger than Yukon-Koyukuk: Of course,
-- one is Alaska itself (FIPS 02). The other two are Texas (FIPS 48),
-- and California (FIPS 06).

SELECT statefp AS st,
       round (
              ( sum(ST_Area(geom::geography) / 2589988.110336))::numeric, 2
             ) AS square_miles
FROM us_counties_2019_shp
GROUP BY statefp
ORDER BY square_miles DESC;

-- 2. Using ST_Distance(), determine how many miles separate these two farmers’
-- markets: The Oakleaf Greenmarket (9700 Argyle Forest Blvd, Jacksonville,
-- Florida) and Columbia Farmers Market (1701 West Ash Street, Columbia,
-- Missouri). You’ll need to first find the coordinates for both in the
-- farmers_markets table.
-- Tip: you can also write this query using the Common Table Expression syntax
-- you learned in Chapter 13.

-- Answer: About 851 miles.

WITH
    market_start (geog_point) AS
    (
     SELECT geog_point
     FROM farmers_markets

FROM market_start, market_end;

-- 3. More than 500 rows in the farmers_markets table are missing a value
-- in the county column, an example of dirty government data. Using the
-- us_counties_2019_shp table and the ST_Intersects() function, perform a
-- spatial join to find the missing county names based on the longitude and
-- latitude of each market. Because geog_point in farmers_markets is of the
-- geography type and its SRID is 4326, you’ll need to cast geom in the Census
-- table to the geography type and change its SRID using ST_SetSRID().

-- Answer:

SELECT census.name,
       census.statefp,
       markets.market_name,
       markets.county,
       markets.st
FROM farmers_markets markets JOIN us_counties_2019_shp census
    ON ST_Intersects(markets.geog_point, ST_SetSRID(census.geom,4326)::geography)
    WHERE markets.county IS NULL
ORDER BY census.statefp, census.name;

-- Note that the query returns 496 rows; not all of the columns missing a county
-- value have values present in the geog_point, latitude, and longitude columns.

-- Also, this query highlights a farmer's market that is mis-geocoded.
-- Can you spot it?

-- 4. The nyc_yellow_taxi_trips table you created in Chapter 12 contains
-- the longitude and latitude where each trip began and ended. Use PostGIS
-- functions to turn the dropoff coordinates into a geometry type and 
-- count the state/county pairs where each drop-off occurred. As with the
-- previous exercise, you’ll need to join to the us_counties_2019_shp table
-- and use its geom column for the spatial join.

-- Answer:

SELECT census.statefp,
       census.name as county,
       count(*) AS dropoffs
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_trips taxi JOIN us_counties_2019_shp census
ON ST_Within(
            ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(taxi.dropoff_longitude, taxi.dropoff_latitude),4269)::geometry, census.geom

-- 1. The earthquakes JSON has a key tsunami that’s set to a value of 1 for 
-- large earthquakes in oceanic regions (though it doesn’t mean a tsunami 
-- actually happened). Using either path or element extraction operators, 
-- find earthquakes with a tsunami value of 1 and include their location, time
-- and magnitude in your results.

-- Answer:

SELECT earthquake -> 'properties' ->> 'place' AS place,
       to_timestamp((earthquake -> 'properties' ->> 'time')::bigint / 1000) AS timestamp,
       (earthquake -> 'properties' ->> 'mag')::numeric AS mag

       (earthquake #>> '{properties, mag}')::numeric AS mag
FROM earthquakes
WHERE (earthquake #>> '{properties, tsunami}') = '1';

-- 2. Use the following CREATE TABLE statement to add the table earthquakes_from_json
-- to your analysis database:

CREATE TABLE earthquakes_from_json (

    title text,
    type text,
    quake_date timestamp with time zone,
    mag numeric,
    place text,
    earthquake_point geography(POINT, 4326),
    url text
);

-- Using field and path extraction operators, write an INSERT statement
-- to fill the table with the correct values for each earthquake. Refer 
-- to the full sample earthquake JSON in your Chapter_16.sql file for any 
-- key names and paths you need.

-- Answer:
-- Note that you could use either field or path operators to retrieve the needed elements.

INSERT INTO earthquakes_from_json

-- 3. Bonus (difficult) question: Try writing a query to generate the 
-- following JSON using the data in the teachers and teachers_lab_access
-- tables from Chapter 13:
{
	"id": 6,

	}, {
		"lab_name": "Science A",
		"access_time": "2022-12-07T10:02:00-05:00"
	}]
}
-- It’s helpful to remember that the teachers table has a one-to-many relationship 
-- with teachers_lab_access; the first three keys must come from teachers, and the 
-- JSON objects in the array of lab_access will come from teachers_lab_access. 
-- Hint: you’ll need to use a subquery in your SELECT list and a function called 
-- json_agg() to create the lab_access array. 

-- Answer:

SELECT to_json(teachers_labs)
FROM (
    SELECT id,
           first_name AS fn,
           last_name AS ln,
        (
            SELECT json_agg(to_json(la))
            FROM (
                SELECT lab_name, access_time
                FROM teachers_lab_access
                WHERE teacher_id = teachers.id
                ORDER BY access_time DESC
            ) AS la
        ) AS lab_access
    FROM teachers 
    WHERE id = 6)
AS teachers_labs;

-- What's happening here? Structurally, we have a series of nested subqueries.
-- We use the first subquery to retrieve the id, first_name, and last_name columns from 
-- the teachers table. In that subquery's SELECT list, we place another subquery that 
-- retrieves the lab_name and access_time from the teachers_lab_access. 

-- What makes this query tricky is that we need to use an inner subquery to generate the
-- lab access objects and use the json_agg function to aggregate the results of those rows
-- into an array.

-- When writing a query such as this, it's helpful to work in chunks. Start with the 
-- outermost query and add the subqueries one by one, testing as you go.

-- facility into the table. Use the inspection_deadline column added in Listing 10-19.
-- You should be able to describe the steps needed to implement a trigger and how 
-- the steps relate to each other.

-- Answer:
-- a) You should have an inspection_deadline column already; if not, add it:

ALTER TABLE meat_poultry_egg_establishments ADD COLUMN inspection_deadline timestamp with time zone;

-- b) Create the function that the trigger will execute.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_inspection_deadline()
    RETURNS trigger AS $$
